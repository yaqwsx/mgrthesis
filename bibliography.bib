	abstract = {A new prototype of a self-reconfigurable modular robot, M-TRAN III, has been developed, with an improved fast and rigid connection mechanism. Using a distributed controller, various control modes are possible: single-master, globally synchronous control or parallel asynchronous control. Self-reconfiguration experiments using up to 24 modules were undertaken by centralized or decentralized control. Experiments using decentralized control examined a modular structure moved in a given direction as a flow produced by local self-reconfigurations. In all experiments, system homogeneity and scalability were maintained: modules used identical software except for their ID numbers. Identical self-reconfiguration was realized when different modules were used in initial configurations.},
