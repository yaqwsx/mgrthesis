\section*{Abstract}

This work presents the RoFI platform -- a platform of distributed metamorphic
robots. The individual robots (modules) can mechanically connect and therefore,
build larger robots (systems) with more capabilities compared to a single
module. The work gives the platform specification and proposes a formalism to
reason about RoFI systems. We develop a suitable docking system for coupling the
robots together, tackle the problem of inter-module communication, design a
primary module of the platform and give means to program such robots. We also
present some of the prototypes based on our designs.

\section*{Keywords}
